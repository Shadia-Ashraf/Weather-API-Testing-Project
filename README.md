## Weather API Testing Project
This project tests the Weather API endpoints using Postman.  
Covers current weather, forecast for 7 days, and validation of response structure and data.

## Features
- Automated tests for status codes, response fields, and data types  
- Validation of forecast length and weather conditions  

## Tools
- Postman  
- JavaScript (for test scripts)

## What I did
- Tested WeatherAPI endpoints: current, forecast, and language variations
- Practiced JavaScript in Postman tests:
  - `console.log()` for debugging
  - `.toLowerCase()` for dynamic text verification
  - validating values with `pm.expect`
  - using parameters and variables in requests
- Created 20+ Postman test cases
- Verified dynamic weather data and handled parameters

## How to run
1. Import the collection into Postman
2. Set `{{Base_URL}}` and `{{API_KEY}}` as environment variables
3. Run the collection
